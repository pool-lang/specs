Interfaces


%!includeconf: config.t2t

== Overview ==
Interfaces are a key concept of Pool.  Intrfaces allow you to write functions
that work with many representations of data as long as they share the required
set of characteristics.  A simple example of this is below.

```
sum { (total: int)( array :Array!int );
	total = 0;

	array.foreach { (i :int)
			total += int;
	}
}
```
